Villa Alexandra is a stunning villa, 13 Kilometres south east of the city of Marrakech and 20 minutes drive from Menara Airport on the road to the Ourika Valley in the direction of the Atlas Mountains.

This private villa is set in a mature five-acre walled garden full of palms, olives, citrus, roses and a large fountain. The cool pure air from the mountains mixed with the scent of the orange trees makes it a wonderful place to relax.

## Villa Alexandra

Villa Alexandra was originally built by a French Colonel 70 years ago. It was completely renovated in 2003. The style is now Mediterranean which compliments its light and spacious rooms. The villa has been beautifully decorated using traditional materials and Tadelakt decorative plaster work along with Zeliges tiles, Diss and Bejmatt local bricks. The rooms in the villa are 4.5 metres high and 0.5 metres thick which provide great insulation.

The drawing room has 1930’s Egyptian wall hangings along with mother of pearl inlaid Syrian mirrors. The bedrooms have silk wall hangings, comfortable beds, ceiling fans and air-conditioning.

At night the front of the villa, drive and fountain are lit by candlelight lanterns. The palm trees in the gardens are also illuminated.

It is the perfect place to stay and to use as a base to visit the medina of Marrakech, the valleys and Berber villages in the Atlas Mountains, or the beaches and fish restaurants of Essaouira. Please visit the activities section for further information.
