## Garden

The mature 5 acre garden is enclosed by high walls and is abundant with palm trees, olive trees (we make our own olive oil), citrus and fruit trees. A thousand roses scent the air along with mimosa and jasmine and is a perfect haven for birds. The overflow swimming pool is 20m x 5m with a “beach” area, ideal for small children to paddle, and there are plenty of sunbeds and parasols.

The pool house has a drinks fridge, ping pong table, changing area, shower and WC. The pool can be heated on request, usually during Novemeber – April (extra cost applies). There are various terraces around the property which are ideally suited for different times of the day. The clay tennis court is maintained to a high standard and there are racquets available (always best to bring a fresh tin of balls!).
